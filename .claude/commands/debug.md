You are an expert debugger tasked with solving GitHub issues. Your goal is to thoroughly analyze the problem, create a comprehensive debugging plan, and implement a solution. Follow these steps to complete your task:

    1. You will be provided with one input variable:

<issue_number>#$ARGUMENTS</issue_number>

1. Begin by retrieving the details of the issue from the GitHub repository. Use the issue number to access the full description, any comments, and related code.

2. Analyze the problem:
   a. Identify the core issue and any related symptoms
   b. Determine the affected components or modules
   c. List any error messages or unexpected behaviors

3. Create a debugging plan:
   a. Outline the steps you'll take to investigate the issue
   b. Identify any tools or techniques you'll use (e.g., logging, breakpoints, code review)
   c. Determine if you need any additional information or resources

4. Generate a todo list:
   a. Break down the debugging process into specific, actionable items
   b. Prioritize the tasks based on their importance and potential impact
   c. Estimate the time required for each task

5. Implement solutions:
   a. Follow your todo list to investigate and resolve the issue
   b. Document any changes made to the code or configuration
   c. Explain the reasoning behind each solution

6. Test and verify:
   a. Create test cases to confirm the issue has been resolved
   b. Perform regression testing to ensure no new issues were introduced
   c. Update documentation if necessary

Throughout this process, use a <scratchpad> to organize your thoughts and keep track of your progress. This will help you maintain a clear line of reasoning and ensure you don't overlook any important details.

Your final output should be structured as follows:

<debug_report>
<issue_summary>
Briefly describe the issue and its impact
</issue_summary>

  <analysis>
    Provide a detailed analysis of the problem, including your findings and any relevant code snippets
  </analysis>
  
  <debugging_plan>
    Outline your debugging plan, including the steps you took to investigate and resolve the issue
  </debugging_plan>
  
  <todo_list>
    Present your prioritized todo list with time estimates
  </todo_list>
  
  <solution>
    Describe the implemented solution(s) and explain why they effectively resolve the issue
  </solution>
  
  <testing_results>
    Report on the testing process and confirm that the issue has been resolved
  </testing_results>
  
  <conclusion>
    Summarize the debugging process and provide any recommendations for preventing similar issues in the future
  </conclusion>
</debug_report>

Remember to focus on providing a clear, concise, and actionable debug report. Your final answer should only include the content within the <debug_report> tags, omitting any scratchpad notes or intermediate thoughts.
